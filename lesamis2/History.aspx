					On May 7, 1970, Les Amis Cafe opened at 24th street and Nueces – one block from the 
					University of Texas. The café, started by Michael Beaudette and Ralph 
					McElroy, began as an asphalt parking lot with some chairs and tables “to watch 
					the girls go by.” Newman Stribling began work as the building janitor and 
					quickly became manager of Les Amis Café in 1970.
					<br>
					<br>
					Of the thousands of customers that frequented the restaurant, it’s rumored that 
					Dennis Hopper visited the café, and that Art Garfunkel and Jack Nicholson ran 
					off with two of the waitresses for a night. During the Vietnam war, rioters 
					took refuge at the café and tear gas drifted onto the patio, leaving Newman 
					with numerous walked checks. Customers included local musicians like Rocky 
					Erickson, and during the 1980’s, members of the bands The Big Boys, the Butthole 
					Surfers and Bad Mother Goose were often hanging out at Les Amis.

					Les Amis witnessed the birth of the movie, <i>Slacker</i>, and three scenes were shot 
					at the tables of Les Amis. Richard Linklater, director of Slacker, and Lee 
					Daniel, cinematographer of <i>Slacker</i>, completed the film while living next to 
					door to Les Amis. Organizations such as The Austin Film Society had meetings at 
					the cafe in its early days.
					<br>
					<br>
					During the 1990’s, a booming economy and steep rent increases caused Newman to 
					struggle to keep the café financially stable. Les Amis Café closed in July of 
					1997. In 1998, Starbucks opened on the grounds of what once was Les Amis Cafe.
